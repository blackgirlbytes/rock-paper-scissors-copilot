# Build a Rock, Paper, Scissors Game with GitHub Copilot

## Description
This is a self-guided tutorial to help folks learn how to use GitHub Copilot. In this project you will find: 
* a `main.py` file with no contents
* a devcontainer that installs CodeTour and GitHub Copilot when the Codespace is created
* a CodeTour to guide the developer through using GitHub Copilot to develop a rock, paper, scissors game. 

## How does this work?
The CodeTour prompts developers to write comments and lines of code that trigger GitHub Copilot to generate code to create a rock, paper, scissors game.

## How to use the guided CodeTour

1. Choose 'Use this template', and 'Open in a codespace'

## Your CodeTour will take you through the following steps
1. Introduction: Hi there! this is a guided tour to help you learn GitHub Copilot. We will build a rock, paper, scissors game with Python. Press Next to to get started 👇
2. Let's give GitHub Copilot some context about what we're building. Write this comment # Write a rock, paper, scissors, game at the top of your main.py file. Press Next to to get started 👇
Now, let's prompt Copilot to import the random module. Write this comment # import random module on the next line. Press enter to create a new line and accept Copilot's suggestion. Press Next to to get started 👇
3. Now, let's prompt Copilot to create a main function that handles the logic of the game with a comment that says # define main function that handles all the logic. Press enter to create a new line and accept Copilot's suggestion. Press Next to to get started 👇
4. Now, let's prompt Copilot to call the main function. Write this comment # call main function on the next line. Press enter to create a new line and accept Copilot's suggestion. Press Next to to get started 👇
5. Try it out! Let's run the code to see if it works. In your terminal, run python main.py. It should start the rock, paper, scissors game. Mission complete! You've used GitHub Copilot to create a rock, paper, scissors game in Python 🎉
